    A context manager for atomic writing to a file. Reimplements atomicwrites.atomic_write from the `atomicwrites
    <https://github.com/untitaker/python-atomicwrites>`_ distribution.

    This creates a temporary file in the same directory as the target file and moves it to the final destination on
    successful write, ensuring atomicity.

    :param file_path: The target file path to write to atomically.
    :param mode: The mode to open the file in.
    :param overwrite: Raise an error if ``path`` exists. This error is only raised after the temporary has been written
                      to.
    :param open_kwargs: Additional keyword arguments passed to `open`.
    :returns: A writable file object.
