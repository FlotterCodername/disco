Discord automation stuff

## How to set it up?

Pull the docker image from the GitHub Container Registry:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/flottercodername/disco
```

Prepare a host directory for the container to store its data, e.g. at `/opt/disco/`:

```
opt/
  disco/
    log/
      disco.log  # Automatically created
    run/
      secrets.toml
    sqlite/
      db.sqlite3  # Automatically created
```

In this directory, the only thing you need to provide ahead of time is your *Discord App secret*. Store this in
`secrets.toml`:

```toml
[disco]
token = "YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
```

Run the container while mounting the host directory at `/opt/disco/`:

```bash
docker run --volume /opt/disco/:/opt/disco/ ghcr.io/flottercodername/disco
```
