Discord automation stuff

## How to get started?

Pull the docker image from the GitHub Container Registry:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/flottercodername/disco
```

Prepare a host directory for the container to store its data, e.g. at `/opt/disco/`:

```
/
  opt/
    disco/
      log/
        disco.log  # Automatically created
      run/
        secrets.toml
        # ... more config files here
      sqlite/
        db.sqlite3  # Automatically created
```

In this directory, the only thing you need to provide ahead of time is the *Bot Token* from your *Discord App*. You can
create a Discord App and get the token from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications),
if you do not have one already. Store this in `secrets.toml`:

```toml
[disco]
token = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ.A1b2C3.abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKL"
```

Run the container while mounting the host directory at `/opt/disco/`:

```bash
docker run --volume /opt/disco/:/opt/disco/ ghcr.io/flottercodername/disco
```

The app should be able to start up, create the database and log file, and connect to Discord. But it will not do
anything useful yet. For that, please refer to the [user guide](https://disco-automate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/).
