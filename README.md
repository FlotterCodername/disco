Discord automation stuff

## How to set it up?

Pull the docker image from the GitHub Container Registry:
```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/flottercodername/disco
```

Prepare your Discord App secret as JSON file for mounting, e.g. at `~/.disco/run/secrets.json`:
```json
{
  "org.flottercodername.disco": {
    "@@token": "YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
  }
}
```

Run the container while mounting the secrets file at `/var/disco/run/secrets.json`:
```bash
docker run --volume ~/.disco/run/secrets.json:/var/disco/run/secrets.json ghcr.io/flottercodername/disco
```
